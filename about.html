                Welcome to my portfolio website, here you can find some of the visual art I have made over the years.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
                My name is Ivan Arena and I am an artist, meaning that I make art, that I create. I live for it.
                I like passing through different mediums and making the most out of the - often limited - tools that get
                in my hands.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">I was born in 2002 in Messina, the nearest city to the rest of Italy from the absurdly
                beautiful island
                of Sicily. Despite my endless love for my homeland, at the age of 18 I left to Padua, near Venice, to
                study Computer Science. As of today, I'm living in Cork, Ireland, for a few months while working for a
                tech company.</p>
            <p class="about-text">At this time, I'm working on several different projects: my first film, which I'm
                shooting in Ireland; my
                third book, a collection of poems; my first LP as PARLEMENT, an eclectic songwriting project I started
                in 2017.</p>
